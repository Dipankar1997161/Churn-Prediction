## Introduction:

Customer churn (or customer attrition) refers to the loss of customers or subscribers for any reason at all. Businesses measure and track churn as a percentage of lost customers compared to total number of customers over a given time period
### Example
If Company ADG had 500 customers at the beginning of the month and only 450 customers at the end of the month, its customer churn rate would be 10%.

## Overview:
In this repo, there are 2 sections.

First, I did a churn prediction on a Telecom Dataset from Kaggle.
Second, I did a Full EDA on a local telecom dataset.

## Results:

Since the kaggle dataset is availale, I will present my results on the local dataset I did.
